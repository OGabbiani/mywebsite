This project analyzed the potential for native wetland plants to remediate minor environmental issues in brackish aquatic systems. To do so four species, Bolboschoenus maritimus, Salicornia pacifica, Jaumea carnosa, and Juncus acutus were placed on floating platorms to create articifial floating wetlands.\nEach plantâ€™s viability and ability to remove carbon and nitrogen from the UCSB Lagoon were analyzed."
