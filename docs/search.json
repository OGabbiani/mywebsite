    "text": "Research\nPhytoremediation and Floating Wetland Islands\nPhytoremediation, or the use of plants to clean up environmental damage, is a growing field whose uses are being widely studied. Most studies and uses of this technique, however, have ocurred in freshwater systems. This project analyzed the potential for phytoremdiation to be conducted in a brackish system using native wetland plants to remediate minor environmental issues. To do so four species, Bolboschoenus maritimus, Salicornia pacifica, Jaumea carnosa, and Juncus acutus were placed on floating platorms to create articifial floating wetlands.\nThe plants remained on the floating wetland islands (FWIs) between January and May during which they grew and interacted with their environment. During their time on the water, each plant’s viability was determined and observations were taken on bird species perching on the FWIs. It was determined that Jaumea carnosa and Juncus acutus are best suited for phytoremediation in the lagoon, as both plant species were healthy and showed strong growth.\nDevelopment and Launch\nDevelopment of this project began in early 2023. I conducted a literature review to understand what other research in the field looked like. This helped me determine how FWIs are typically built, where they are placed, and what potential results could look like. Additionally, I conducted research on the UCSB Lagoon itself by consulting with various lagoon stewards to determine which plants would be best suited for this purpose, and where to place the FWIs.\nPlants were grown at the CCBER Nursery over the summer and the FWIs were built Fall Quarter. They were constructed out of PVC Piping, 5-gallon pots, and burlap bags. Their placement on the UCSB Lagoon was determined on the location of drainage outflows within the lagoon as well as proximity to areas of major runoff. The Arts Lawn is both an area of runoff and a major drainage point. Additionally, it is close to the floating dock, allowing an on-water launch point.\nThe FWIs were launched in early 2024. The assembled FWIs were brought to the UCSB Lagoon where plants were measured and then placed in pots. The completed islands were then placed in the water and towed out (by kayak) to their respective anchor points.\nResults\nIt was determined that Jaumea carnosa and Juncus acutus are best suited for phytoremediation in the lagoon, as both plant species were healthy and showed strong growth. The biomass from both of these plants, and their respective controls, is currently being analyzed through UCSB’s MSI Lab."

    "text": "On this site, you can take a look at my independent research project and the things I love doing outside of school, namely hiking and cooking!\nIndependent Research\nOver this school year, I worked on an independent research project looking into the ability of plants to remediate environmental damage and pollution on the UCSB Lagoon. This required developing a research question and proposal, writing grants, constructing and conducting the experiment, and collecting data.\nTo conduct this experiment I incorporated knowledge from Environmental Studies classes I had previously taken including: \n   - ES 95: Introduction to Ecological Restoration Field Skills\n   - ES 137: Conservation Planning  \n   - ES 114: Soils of California  \nHiking and Cooking\nOutside of school and research some of my favorite activities are cooking and hiking. While I enjoy both of these activities, they also allow me to connect with and experience my French, Swiss, and Italian cultural identity. Cooking traditional meals ties me back to where I am from and allows me to maintain my relationship to my family and culture. Hiking lets me experience the outdoors and connect with people and the planet."
