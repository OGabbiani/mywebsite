On this site, you can take a look at my independent research project and the things I love doing outside of school, namely hiking and cooking!


**Independent Research**

Over this school year, I worked on an independent research project looking into the ability of plants to remediate environmental damage and pollution on the UCSB Lagoon. This required developing a research question and proposal, writing grants, constructing and conducting the experiment, and collecting data.

To conduct this experiment I incorporated knowledge from Environmental Studies classes I had previously taken including: 

   - ES 95: Introduction to Ecological Restoration Field Skills

   - ES 137: Conservation Planning  

   - ES 114: Soils of California  


**Hiking and Cooking**

Outside of school and research some of my favorite activities are cooking and hiking. While I enjoy both of these activities, they also allow me to connect with and experience my French, Swiss, and Italian cultural identity. Cooking traditional meals ties me back to where I am from and allows me to maintain my relationship to my family and culture. Hiking lets me experience the outdoors and connect with people and the planet.
