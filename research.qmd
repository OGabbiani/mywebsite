Phytoremediation and Floating Wetland Islands 

Phytoremediation, or the use of plants to clean up environmental damage, is a growing field whose uses are being studied. This project analyzed the potential for native wetland plants to remediate minor environmental issues in brackish aquatic systems. To do so four species, *Bolboschoenus maritimus, Salicornia pacifica, Jaumea carnosa, and Juncus acutus* were placed on floating platorms to create articifial floating wetlands. 

Each plant's viability and ability to remove carbon and nitrogen from the UCSB Lagoon were analyzed.
