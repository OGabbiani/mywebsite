Phytoremediation and Floating Wetland Islands 

Phytoremediation, or the use of plants to clean up environmental damage, is a growing field whose uses are being widely studied. Most studies and uses of this technique, however, have ocurred in freshwater systems. This project analyzed the potential for phytoremdiation to be conducted in a brackish system using native wetland plants to remediate minor environmental issues. To do so four species, *Bolboschoenus maritimus, Salicornia pacifica, Jaumea carnosa, and Juncus acutus* were placed on floating platorms to create articifial floating wetlands.

The plants remained on the floating wetland islands (FWIs) between January and May during which they grew and interacted with their environment. During their time on the water, each plant's viability was determined and observations were taken on bird species perching on the FWIs. It was determined that *Jaumea carnosa* and *Juncus acutus* are best suited for phytoremediation in the lagoon, as both plant species were healthy and showed strong growth.
